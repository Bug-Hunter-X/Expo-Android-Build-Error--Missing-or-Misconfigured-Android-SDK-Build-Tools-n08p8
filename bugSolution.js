To fix this, ensure the following:

1. **Install the necessary Android SDK components:** Open the Android SDK Manager (usually accessible through the Android Studio SDK Manager) and make sure you've installed the necessary build-tools, platform-tools, and the Android SDK itself.  The specific build tools version may be mentioned in the error message.  Update them if required.

2. **Set environment variables:** Verify that your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly and points to your Android SDK installation directory. Also, ensure that `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` and `%ANDROID_HOME%\tools` are added to your system's `PATH` environment variable. (On Linux/macOS, it may be `$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools` and `$ANDROID_HOME/tools` and the path is set using the shell's appropriate method.)

3. **Check Java JDK installation:**  Ensure you have a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.  Expo often needs JDK 8 or 11.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's build files and then running a fresh build: `expo prebuild` then `expo build:android`.

5. **Gradle Issues:**  Issues with Gradle can sometimes cause similar errors. Try invalidating cache and restart in Android Studio. If using Gradle directly (outside of expo), check the Gradle version, and make sure your Gradle configuration is correct and it can resolve dependencies.

6. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:**  Ensure your Expo CLI and the Expo SDK versions in your project are up-to-date. Outdated versions can be a source of compatibility problems.

7. **Restart your computer/IDE:** This sometimes fixes issues caused by cached settings or inconsistencies.

If you've followed these steps and still experience the issue, please check the error message carefully, as it might provide more specific details on the problem.  Providing the full error message when seeking support can help others diagnose the issue more effectively.
